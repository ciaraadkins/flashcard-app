# Update Instructions

## To fix the Airtable integration issue:

1. First, install the updated Airtable package:
```bash
npm install airtable@latest
```

2. Or specifically:
```bash
npm install airtable@0.12.2
```

3. Restart the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Changes Made:

1. **Added debug logging** to see exactly what data is being sent to Airtable
2. **Cleaned up undefined values** - only sending defined fields to Airtable
3. **Updated error handling** - better error messages with the failed data
4. **Updated package.json** to use the latest Airtable version

The debug logs will now show in your terminal when creating records, which will help identify any data issues.
